# Intro to Serum

Serum is a powerful synthesizer with all necessary features built in. I watched
a deadmau5 studio session to imitate some of what he was doing with the LFO
output to the Filter cutoff input. This is achieved by dragging from the LFO
screen to any knob you want it to control.

Deadmau5 has livestreams on YouTube. Too bad you can't always see the screen.
